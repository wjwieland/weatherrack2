		Change arduino code to only send data if there is a significant change in values.  This will save on storage space on the PRi and battery on the arduino. will need to extrapolate data on user interface!  
		
		Set up lipo charger so that it does not flutter on and off when solar panel is not producing much power.  Need a schotkey diode and a few capacitors for this.  Also need to pick up a few 3.7v batteries from the hobby shop.
		
		Need to adjust XBees so the endpoint runs in sleep mode and broadcasts under high power.  

2015-12-29	1. still need to finish up the charger to protect from flutter
 		2. add routine to only send from arduino if data has changed 
		   in order to reduce data storage requirements and power used
		   by the XBee.
		3. Adjust XBee endpoint to go into sleep mode cyclic4 mode.
		4. Calibrate both the rain gage and the anemometer.
